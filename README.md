I am developing a universal operating system for gamers, developers, hackers, and everyday users. My goals include:

- High performance – an optimized kernel with support for modern technologies.  
- Developer-friendly environment – a powerful terminal, package managers, and coding tools.  
- Security and customization – advanced protection and extensive customization options.  
- Modern design – a balance between minimalism and functionality.  

The project is in the early stages of development and will be open-source. Stay tuned for updates!
